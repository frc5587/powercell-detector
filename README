accuracy: 95.4%

speed: 66.7 fps

ball accuracy: 64.1%

This version used 4 different filters (manually tuned) and essentially nothing else

accuracy: 93.0%

speed: 86.0 fps

ball accuracy: 56.4%

## -- v3 --
This version uses 4 filters all tuned by a neural network

accuracy: 96.3%

speed: 92.7 fps

ball accuracy: 74.8%

## -- v4 -- 
This version uses 4 filters all tuned by a neural network, but with a wider dataset. Even though it looks better on paper is actually may be worse than v3, this tends to also calls pieces of the wheel of fortune powercells.
